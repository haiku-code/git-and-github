### Material for self learning
You should at least get to know these terms and know they exist,
even if you don't know them in depth.
most would be a reading of 5 minutes. Be sure to play with the demos!

in the last link see the usage of a single var for both instances:
``` js
var ins1 = new Class(),
    ins2 = new Class();
```
this should be voided, use:

``` js
const ins1 = new Class();
const ins2 = new Class();
```
