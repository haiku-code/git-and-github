### In the old days...

How do you keep versions without a version control system?

---

### Why using VCS?

* Code backup
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Keep code history
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Book keeping of changes (who did what)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Sync code between developers
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Why Git?
* Today git is the standard VCS, and the most used one
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Fast(er)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Design for distributed development (most operation are local)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Good for any size of project
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Files in Git has three main states: modified, staged, and committed:

* Staging area - a file that stores the changes to be saved in the next commit (also called index)
* Stash 
* .git directory - where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project
